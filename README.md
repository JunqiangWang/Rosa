Rosa--Regulon Structure-based Activity inference

version 0.7.7

### The statsitical model of Rosa

Rosa performs regulon structure-based activity inference, a statistical model for quantitative inference of protein activities using reverse-engineered gene regulatory networks from scRNA-seq. Rosa calculates a normalized enrichment score (NES) that represents the protein activities of the candidate regulators.
