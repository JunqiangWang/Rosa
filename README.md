Rosa--Regulon Structure-based Activity inference

version 0.7.7

### The statsitical model of Rosa

Rosa performs regulon structure-based activity inference, a statistical model for quantitative inference of protein activities using gene regulatory networks reverse-engineered from scRNA-seq. Rosa calculates a normalized enrichment score (NES) that represents the protein activities of the candidate regulators. 

### The network-based inference framework  
![](https://github.com/JunqiangWang/Rosa/blob/main/Illustrative%20Figures/Figure_ProteinActivityInference.png)  
#### Step 1  
Run ARACNe, which was developed by the Andrea Califano lab.
#### Step 2  
Run Rosa.
