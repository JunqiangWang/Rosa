Rosa--RegulOn Structure-based Activity inference

version 0.777

### The illustrative framework of Rosea

Rosa performs regulon structure-based activity inference, which is a statistical model for quantitative inference of the protein activities using reversed-engineered gene regulatory networks from scRNA-seq. Rosa calculates a normalized enrichment score (NES) representing the protein activities of the candidate regulators. 

There are several essential elements in the model: first, candidate regulators and associated targets; second, the regulatory modes (mod_reg) including positive regulation or the negative regulation; third, the weights of regulatory strengths (w_reg); and fourth, the normalized gene expression Z scores.
